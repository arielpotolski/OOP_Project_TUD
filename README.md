# Starting template

This README will need to contain a description of your project, how to run it, how to set up the development environment, and who worked on it.
This information can be added throughout the course, except for the names of the group members.
Add your own name (do not add the names for others!) to the section below.

## Description of project
The project aims to **increase** the energy awareness of the player. In modern society, the average person takes energy for granted without
actually realising how their actions influence **energy consumption** of the whole world. Through this interactive game we, the developers, hope
that every player will become not only more aware of their energy usage but also be surprised by how much or how little certain actions take in comparison to others.

The game includes two game modes:
#### Single Player
- Here everybody can play on their own with a new set of questions every time
- It includes 4 different types of questions
  - Multiple Choice Question
    - In this type of question the player is presented with an activity and three answers out of which only one is correct. They need to answer this question by clicking on the button with the answer they think is correct
  - Highest Consumption Question
    - In this type of question the user is presented with three different activities. They need to choose which one consumes the most energy
  - Instead Of Question
    - In this type of question the player is presented with four activities in total. As the name of the type suggests, the user is asked instead of one of the activities which one can be done with the same amount of energy, and they need to choose one of the activities presented in the answer.
  - Estimate Question
    - In this type of question the player is presented with one activity, and they need to estimate how much it takes to be executed. The closer the guess is to the original consumption in terms of order of magnitude the more points the player is given in the end
- And remember, the faster you answer, the more points you get

#### Multiplayer
- Here a user can have fun with their friends while becoming aware of new facts
- It has the following features:
  - Waiting lobby, where a user can wait for their friends
  - Once 'Start' is clicked everybody simultaneously gets into a game
  - In the game people are again presented with the same types of question
  - There is a live chat, where people can express their thoughts while also expressing their emotions through the emoji feature
  - Every player is given three jokers:
    - Time attack - this one reduces the time of all other players with a certain percentage
    - Double points - this one gives double the points you get for a certain question
    - Eliminate Wrong Answer - eliminates a wrong answer
  - You can see how you are doing in comparison to the others in a leaderboard after each answer where everybody's points are depicted


#### You want to contribute with activities
- Then you can just open the Admin Panel and from there you can create your own sets of activities, edit existing ones, delete and what not

## How to run it
- In order to run it you just need to install gradle and run the application by typing *gradle run*
- There is a default server, but you can join whichever you like by adding a config file where you specify the IP of the server.
- The config file needs to be placed in the repository folder, and you name it just *quizzzz.config*

## How to contribute to it
Everybody is free to download the whole game and develop. Once you want to contribute you can contact every one of the developers so that they can discuss with everybody else the changes made to the project
