# Code of Conduct

## Goal and Effort
- We are aiming for a grade of 10.
- We aim to build a fully featured, stable, and aesthetically pleasing java quiz application
    which satisfies all the requirements listed in the backlog.
- All team members should try to work for about 20 hours per week on the project.

## Quality Standards
- Code must be reviewed by at least two other team members before merging.
- Code must pass all unit tests and formatting rules (e.g. checkstyle or other) before merging.
- Each new feature must be properly tested, especially edge-cases.
- All methods should have documentation so that the code is readable at any stage of the project.
- Documents must also be reviewed by at least two team members to ensure quality of work.

## Communication
- Code is shared on GitLab. Code reviews are also done there.
- Team discussions happen on Discord or in person.
- Communication with the TA is done on Discord, Mattermost, or in person.

## Meetings
- Meetings are held at least once per week on Tuesday with the TA.
    Often a second meeting will be held on Thursday.
- If someone is going to be late to a meeting, they should notify others.
    If they are going to be late by more than 15 minutes, the meeting starts without them.

### Requirements for Chairman
- Must prepare an agenda ahead of the meeting and merge it on GitLab.
- Must conduct the meeting according to their agenda.
- Must discuss all important points for that week.

### Requirements for Note Taker
- Must take extensive yet concise notes of the meeting.
- Notes must include explanations for each topic of discussion.
- Must submit the notes on GitLab before deadline.

## Division of Labour
- At the start of the week we will choose which tasks we want to have finished by the end of the week.
- Then, if any team members have a strong preference they can pick an issue.
- The other issues are assigned by random.
- Less experienced team members are then paired up with more experienced team members if possible.
- When switching fields (e.g. from frontend to backend) one person from the pair should stay so that they can pass on the knowledge.

## Deadlines
- All members will aim to finish their assignments at least one day before a deadline
    so that they are available to help in the case that someone is stuck.

## Dealing with Conflicts
- In general a conflict between two parties is resolved through
    a discussion with the other team members and optionally a majority vote.
- In special cases and if both parties agree, they can resolve the conflict with a *duel*.
    In a duel, each party picks a game and the other team members pick a third game.
    The party which wins at least 2/3 games wins the conflict.

### Struggling Team Members
- If a team member has issues with meeting their deadlines, others will attempt to help if they are done with their own work.
- If the team member continuously fails to contribute or refuses to work, it will be brought up to the TA through an official channel.

## Guidance
- We would like feedback from the TA about our work as a team.
- We want to know if there are any obvious issues with our work.
- We would like to be reminded of important deadlines.

## Git Etiquette
- Commits must begin with a capital letter and a verb in infinitive form
    (e.g. Add, Fix, Remove).
- Commits should address only one change.
- Branches names are lowercase and use `-` as word separators.
- Merge requests should in general only solve one issue.
