# Code of Conduct

## Goal
- We aim to build a fully featured and stable java quiz application.

## Code Standards
- Code must be reviewed by at least two other team members before merging.
- Code must pass all unit tests and formatting rules before merging.

## Communication
- Code is shared on GitLab. Code reviews are also done there.
- Team discussions happen on Discord or in person.

## Meetings
- Meetings are held at least once per week on Tuesday with the TA.
    Often a second meeting will be held on Thursday.
- If someone is going to be late to a meeting, they should notify others.
    If they are going to be late by more than 15 minutes, the meeting starts without them.

## Deadlines
- All members will aim to finish their assignments at least one day before a deadline
    so that they are available to help in the case that someone is stuck.

## Dealing with Conflicts
- In general a conflict between two parties is resolved through
    a discussion with the other team members and optionally a majority vote.
- In special cases and if both parties agree, they can resolve the conflict with a *duel*.
    In a duel, each party picks a game and the other team members pick a third game.
    The party which wins at least 2/3 games wins the conflict.
- If a team member refuses to contribute and all other members agree,
    they will take the issue to the TA and discuss possible solutions.

## Git Etiquette
- Commits must begin with a capital letter and a verb in infinitive form
    (e.g. Add, Fix, Remove).
- Commits should address only one change.
- Branches names are lowercase and use `-` as word separators.
- Merge requests should in general only solve one issue.
