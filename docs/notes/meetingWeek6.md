# Demo

## Frontend

-   Single player works.
-   There is a global leaderboard, but data isn't pretty printed.
-   You can answer questions, theres a timer between them, and they go
    sequentially (can't go backwards in single player mode).

## Backend

-   The server mostly works, but there is no frontend connected to it (yet).
-   Server uses REST obviously.
-   Players have IDs so we can differenciate between new players and ones
    refreshing their connections.

# Feedback

-   We have a lot of unmerged merge requests.
-   We should be properly assigning merge requests.
-   Create a document or something so that the TA can see our planning.
-   Our communication is kind of lacking.
-   We can assign reviews to merge requests, so maybe we should rotate assignments
    with reviewing code.

NOTE: We can use `git-inspector` to see how much different people do.
