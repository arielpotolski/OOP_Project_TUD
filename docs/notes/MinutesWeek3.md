# MINUTES MEETING 2

## Done Last Week
- Dimitar: jfx, project report, ui design
- Villiam: wrote the code of conduct, issues
- Thomas: checkstyle configuration, looked at documentation of SpringBoot (having problems with scene builder and jfx)
- Ariel: Watched the tutorials on spring and edited Dimitar's ui design.
- Alex: SpringBoot documentation and repository
- Viet: SpringBoot and studied about java jfx
- Everyone: Created the issues on GitLab and Code of Conduct.

## Feedbacks
- Code of conduct:
    - Good things (assignment description) but missing some parts: 
        - missing the part for how much effort we want to put into it; how we want to achieve the 10?
        - Product: list the things we actually want to have at the end of the project.
        - Quality standard for the assignments, how to measure it (have concrete thing, as having all the assignments 
      with a minimum quality, how do we feel satisfied about the document/product).
        - Be more concrete on how we want to divide the tasks
        - Be more concrete on how we measure the work of the others in the group (chairman, secretary, etc).
        - Guidance (what we actually expect from the TA, as what we would like feedback on, etc).
        - Rewrite the 'dealing with conflicts' part of the code of conduct, since it is not very clarified how we will deal with that.
    - Submit the new document until tomorrow (02/23 at 23:59).
    - Git etiquette was nice
    
- Backlog:  
    - Good use of weight and labels, and good use of user-stories.
    - Make a todo list, add on the description how do we implement each step. Convert issues that are too long into smaller titles.
    - We can change the issues from now on (either delete or add issues).
    - Use milestones and spring to keep organized

## Milestones
- For the git, is important that everyone has a merge request and evaluation on a merge request.
- create stages labels (done, reviewed, etc).
- try not to fail the pipeline, but if we do the next merge request should be done to fix that.
- We should have the must haves done in two weeks.
- Doesn't work on the parts of the project separately; it's better to work on all aspects of the program at the same time.
- We are going to use the Windows line endings.

## HCI assignment
- Get review from another group or other friends to review our UI design.
- It may be better to do separate feedbacks for each person. 
- We find another group to evaluate our UI.
- Everybody is going to work on the report.

## Task Distribution
- First divide the must haves.
- One idea is to work on pairs, and every week one person of each group changes to another group. After the first change, the person who was older on that field should switch to another group.

## API endpoints
- We need to have one endpoint for this Friday.
- Make an HTTP request (we're using the local host for the project).
- Read the annotations on the spring tutorial Iarina sent us.
- For the Database, we don't need to configure it. We're going to use JPA repositories (it would be nice to watch a tutorial on it).
- To test the API we can use a program called Postman where we can test the backend without having the frontend.
- For the backend part: look for repositories, controllers and entities.
        
## Week Deadlines
- Code of Conduct (02/23 - 23:59);
- HCI report, API endpoint working, assignments 3a and 3b on endpoints. (All deu on friday, but the HCI draft report have some flexibility).

## ToDo's
- Everyone: Code of Conduct;
- Everyone: API endpoint;
- Everyone: Work on the HCI assignment;
- Everyone: Search for info about JPA repositories, controllers, and entities for the backend.
