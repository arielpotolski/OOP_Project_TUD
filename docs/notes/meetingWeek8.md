## TA Feedback

### Planning
- better but still not good
- when planning, assign ALL issues for that week
- plan in advance, even before meeting
- Make sure issue complexity is similar between team members

### Testing
- better than most teams
- but continue improving it

### Individual Feedback

#### Alex
- should have merged, not just merge requests

#### Ariel
- Ariel should pick more issues where he works alone

## Testing Frontend
- do not have to test GUI
- extract logic into another method and test that
- serverUtils do not have to be tested
    - we do not have to use Mojito, but we can

## Thomas's Big Merge Request
- should be fine to merge

## Deadlines
- Assignment 5B [1st of April]
- BuddyCheck [8th of April]

## Final Assessment
- Rubric is not up yet, but will be soon
- Look at TU Present module

- Present by making a video (it will not be live)
    - Create demo and show majority of features
    - We can also be more technical (e.g. explaining why we use TCP)
- Q&A session is in-person

- We can do a Zoom call next week for a mock presentation
    - TA is available on Tuesday
    - We should let her know by the end of this week about the mock presentation

## Summary
- Merge your code
- Alex, take more issues
- Ariel, work on more issues on your own
- Don't forget about BuddyCheck and Assignment 5B
- Let TA know whether we want mock presentation
