# Agenda for 2022-02-14

## Discuss backlog draft and get feedback from TA
- format
    - user story format is perfect
    - specificity is good
    - drawbacks:
        - power-ups
        - type-of-questions which are too long wiht multiple items in them
        - shorten/split them up
        - When uploading on gilab do not use template but add the MOSCOW beginning everywhere
        - Use key words when transferring to gitlab
        - they need to be prioritized because priority is crucial
        - Order by priority not by role
        - Make sure to add time estimation when uploading on gitlab
        - Listen to the lecture tomorrow to know how to add it
        - In the description of the list put a to do list with descriptive steps
        - Create labels for the must should could and status, e.g. what is the status, is it scheduled for the week;
- completeness
    - not enough information, only on the structure
    - It depends on us
    - It looks good and it is close to perfect ONLY PRIORITIZATION!!!
- priority of tasks (currently not included) - answered above
- who will translate backlog to the GitLab issues - we will do it on our own **we need to pick a responsible person for this task**

## Code of Conduct
- what are the requirements (ask TA)
    - Deadline this Friday
    - there is a template on Brightspace but feel free to disrespect some aspects
    - Not really anything specific
    - It should be something feasible and be sure that everybody agrees with them
    - It is up to us how to deal with the processes; 
- what do we think should be in it
    - This aspect is to be discussed soon; **we have to schedule it**

## Git ettiquette
- first merge requests (adding yourself to group members) 
    - Start all commit messages with capital letter and verb
    - Use commit descriptions not just 'Fixed Bug'
    - Make the description on point
    - Keep them short; Add multiple commits if needed but do not make it too long so that order could be kept;
- Branch names
    - we use '-' for spaces
    - Only add issues if they are important
    - Whenever solving an issue prefix the branch with the number
- Merging
    - The person with the merge request is the one supposed to be merging
    - Make sure that everybody has at least one merge request per week!!!
    - Everybody should have reviews on merge requests
- Dev branch
    - to make sure that everything works before merging to the main branch
    - The recommendation is to add a development branch
    - Enforced at least two responses and reviews to the development branch;
- how many reviews needed per PR
- branch names, commit message style

## Tasks for the week
- adjust and complete backlog according to feedback
- add all group members to README
- agree on checkstyle configuration

## Deadlines

- HCI week three Friday
