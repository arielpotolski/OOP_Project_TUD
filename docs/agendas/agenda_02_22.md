# Opening
*Here you check that everybody is present.*

# Approval of the agenda
*Make sure everything that needs to be discussed is in the agenda or add it if something is missing.*

# Points of action

- Standup Meeting
    - Get everyone to share what they've done since the last meeting.

- Feedback
    - Code of Conduct
    - Backlog

- GitLab Conduct/Practices
    - This should have already been mostly covered, but discuss if there are any other practices or
      convensions we want to follow on GitLab.

- Frameworks and whatnot
    - Figure out how comfortable or knowledgable people are with the required tools/frameworks/etc.
        - Gradle
        - OpenJFX
        - SpringBoot

- HCI Assignment
    - Distribute roles
        - Find another group to evaluate
        - Create a prototype
        - Write the evaluation report

- Task Distribution
    - Discuss the different tasks that need to be completed.
    - Assign tasks to different team members, perhaps based on their familiarity with certain tools
      and frameworks.
        - UI Design
        - Question Creation
        - Client <-> Server Communication
            - REST or WebSockets, or both? ~NOTE: Await response on Mattermost from Sebastian.~

            Response from Sebastian:
            > Hey @all, I would like to jump into the discussion about whether your must use REST or
            > can use other techniques. The short answer is yes, you must use REST. You will need it
            > later in your studies and in your career, so we want to make sure that you know how to
            > use it. The slightly less short answer is, yes, but you can complement it with other
            > techniques like long-polling or websockets to make your application more responsive.
            > You still need to use REST, but you could use, for example, websockets for scenarios
            > like the emoji feature, where more reactive data distribution is required. Finally, the
            > long answer is provided in another video tutorial that I have created for you
            > (Processing might still take some time). My goal in that video is to a) show everybody
            > how to implement the different techniques in your application to get everybody on the
            > same page (the Spring learning curve is steep) and b) to illustrate that the difference
            > between these techniques is only a minor detail and should not matter for your overall
            > system architecture. The video is completely optional, but I hope that it can help to
            > eliminate the last major (technical) barriers for people that are still struggling.


        - Any other ideas?
    - Agree on a time to meet and discuss progress.
    - Focus on getting a minimally usable interface.

- API Endpoints
    - Agree on what kinds of API endpoints we should have.
    - Remember that we *can* use websockets for certain tasks.

- Miscellaneous
    - Agree on a name for the exceptions
    - Agree on a file naming convension (snake_case vs camelCase).

# Action points for next week (Scrum board)
*Every week you fill the Scrum board with new action points for that week. See the to do list for the items you should implement.*

# Any other business
*If anybody has something that should be discussed but came up with that after the agenda was finalized (in point 2), he/she should bring that up now so that it can be discussed after all.*

# Questions for the TA
*Your TA will visit you in the second half of the lab session. Note down all questions that you have so that you can ask them then.*

# Question round
*If there are any questions, now is the time to ask them.*

# Closing
*Now you can start working on the project. Good luck!*
