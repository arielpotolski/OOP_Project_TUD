Date:          {15/03/2022} \
Chairman:      {Ariel Potolski Eilat} \
Secretary:     {Thomas Voss}


# Opening
- Everybody talks about what they did in the previous two weeks (exam week in the middle).
  - it may take a little longer, given it has been 2 weeks since our last meeting, good chance to update everyone on 
  what has already been done.

# Approval of the agenda
- Would anyone like to add something that is not in the agenda yet?

# Points to be discussed
## 1. Scenes Design
- The resizing problems were mostly fixed, ask if everyone agrees with it.
- Discuss how we can change the design to make our application looks nicer (e.g. color schemes).

## 2. Question Set
- A discussion was raised on discord on whether we should have a java class which handles
creating a question set for each game, or if we should handle that in the activity controller.
- Discuss this and have a decision.

## 3. Iarina's general feedback
- Ask Iarina how the project is going from her point of view. How is our progress compared to other
groups.
- Any specific tips or things that clearly need to be fixed.
- Maybe ask for the color scale feedback.

## 4. Code Reviewing
- Stress out the importance of reviewing the merge requests, 
since that seems to be our major bottleneck at the moment.
- Discuss how we tackle that problem and handle the code review.

## 5. BuddyCheck
- Just confirm that everybody did it, and make sure everybody reads the feedback
they received from the others.

## 6. Next steps
- What are the next issues we should tackle?
- Divide the tasks among the group.

# A.O.B
- Ask again if anyone wants to discuss anything that was not discussed in the meeting so far.

# Question Round
- Check if anyone has any questions regarding what was discussed in the meeting
or any other questions about the project.

#Closing
- The meeting is closed.
