# Opening
- Everybody reports what they have done the previous week

# Points for discussion

## 1. Adding images to the game
- Are you all okay with the implementation provided
- How are we going to proceed with the objects

## 2. Feedback for the issues finished so far
- How is the project going
- Are we on track with the implementations

## 3. Division of tasks is still a problem
- Nobody communicates what they are doing anywhere
- There is no systematic contribution to the repository.
- This leads to a lot of merge conflicts later on

## 4. Discuss flags for the week
- Ask for analysis of contribution file
- Ask for the file with the flags

## 5. No full use of the features on GitLab
- Why so?
- Make milestones
- Contribute systematically to your branches
- Make everything visible and report about it
- Make clear the contributions you are doing

## 6. Discussion round
- Do you have any questions?
- Things to be discussed

## Closing
- The meeting is closed
- Final remarks
